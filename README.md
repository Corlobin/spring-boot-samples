# Spring Boot

Provided here is a collection of sample code for [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/). Some of the examples are written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) as the community is showing a great deal of interest for moving in that direction!

## What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot makes it rediculously easy to build advanced software using Java and the Spring Framework. It's ecosystem consists of popular components like [Spring Security](https://projects.spring.io/spring-security/), [Spring Data](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data/), [Spring Integration](https://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/), [Spring Batch](https://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/), and much more. 

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get application running from scratch is to use [http://start.spring.io](http://start.spring.io/). Select the options you want, download the zip file, unpack it and run with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). 

[Spring Boot CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#cli) is another great way to develop applications. You can perform all the same actions from the web interface directly within your terminal, along with a bunch of other cool things.

```bash
$ spring init --dependencies=web,data-jpa my-project
Using service at https://start.spring.io
Project extracted to '/Users/developer/example/my-project'
```

A purchased version of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) has advanced support for Spring providing similiar features directly within the IDE. 

## Learning

The Spring Framework moves fast so it's important to stay up to date, here are a few ways.
