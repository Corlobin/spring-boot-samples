# Spring API Error Framework
Spring deals with mostly Runtime Errors and does a fairly good job at handling and presenting them to you in a meaningful way. These errors will continue to propagate up to a point where they can be handled. For a standard web application the Controller is the last point where you normally have access to handle such exception but Spring provides a better way to deal with them.
